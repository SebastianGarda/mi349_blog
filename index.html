                <p id="paragraph-1">
                    Play Station All Stars Battle Royale is a game with an incredible premise that just barely misses the mark 
                    due to a few missteps. I wan't a sequel so bad, and now that Smash Brothers Ultimate has finally finished 
                    it's dlc character additions I think now is the perfect time to consider what a potential sequel to this 
                    unfortuante flop could change to make it a perfect competitor in the platform fighter genre. For one I think 
                    the most obvious mistake the game made was its roster. So many odd choices and omissions make it much less appealing 
                    than the Smash roster. Using DmC Dante as opposed to regular Dante for example, or neglecting Playstation icons like 
                    Crash and Spyro. For the most part I'm not actually all that mad with what's currently there (except DmC Dante swap him 
                    out), but there are so many cool additions that could be added. Any Fromsoftware representation would be first on my list 
                    and the most obvious from those games is the Hunter from Bloodborne seeing as that game is still PS4 exclusive. Again I'd 
                    add Crash and Spyro as I think they're super iconic to the playstation brand. Pyramid Head would be a super fun horror rep, 
                    something smash sorely lacks, and Sub Zero and Scorpion would be cool western fighting game reps. I also think that just 
                    because smash already has a character in their game doesn't mean PSASBR2 couldn't use them as well. Snake, Cloud and Sephiroth, 
                    and Sora are all huge characters on Sony platforms. I'd also say an Atlus rep would be cool, but it doesn't have to be Joker. 
                    I'd be fine with the protagonists from either P3 or P4 as well or even the Shin Megami Tensei 3 or 5 main character. 
                    The coolest thing about Smash is also the fact that they pull from other companies to complete their roster. I know it's a 
                    farfetched idea but it'd be so cool for Sony to get Microsoft characters in PSASBR2. A Killer Instinct character, Master Cheif, 
                    Conker or any other big Microsoft character would feel like such a cool achievement. Even beyond that could you imagine if 
                    Nintendo allowed one of their characters in the game? I know it's far fetched but Link was a character in Soul Calibur at one 
                    point. Imagine in PSASBR2 Mario gets invited in. It would honestly be the hypest thing to ever happen in the history of gaming.

                <p id="paragraph-1-2">
                    Another mistake that Play Station All Stars makes is that it tries too hard to be different from Smash but at the same 
                    time rips so much of it's game design from Smash. I'd love for it to choose one direction over the other. Personally I'd 
                    prefer for it to go more Smash than traditional Fighting Game but either way it needs to decide what it is. I think the 
                    sumo wrestling mechanic of knocking your oponent out of the ring is one of the coolest distinctions between the platform 
                    fighter genre and other fighting games and I'd love to see PSASBR2 adopt that as its primary method as well. I don't mind the 
                    super moves, but I think if they are kept in they should either be togglable in a menu similar to final smash meter in Ultimate 
                    or be balanced so every level of the super meters does a specific amount of knockback so they can be played around. I'd just 
                    prefer them not be instakils. I also, in the event that the super meters stay, would like for the orb collection mechanic to 
                    be replaced with the meter just filling up when you hit your oponent. That way there's less random factors to you getting your 
                    super. I also would like the stages to be changed completely. I really like the theming of them in the first game, how every 
                    stage is a mashup of two properties, but because of this no single property gets a chance to shine in any one stage. On top 
                    of that the layouts of some are unplayable for competitive play. So much so that the competitive scene of the game when it 
                    existed was forced to play on only the plain training stages. I'd like it if there were some stages (at least 3-5) that had 
                    simple layouts conducive to normal competitive platform fighter play. The theming mashups can stay but I think each character 
                    having their own stage with unique theming is cooler. And of course having plenty of gimmicky big stages for fun casual play is 
                    a must. Also toggleable items and assists would be cool additions but maybe that's taking too much from Smash. Finally, I'm 
                    actually ok with the input system being a lot closer to an actual fighting game than the usual platform fighters four strong, 
                    four light, four special tradition. It can stay that way, it's a super unique addition. If it were to be replaced with normal 
                    smash controls however, I'd be perfectly ok with that.
